## Installation

npm start

## Usage

This terminal-based application asks the user to choose one from the available vehicles or make a new vehicle (car, truck, motorbike). The user can do specific things with the chosen vehicle, for example, accelerate 5 miles, turn left or right, and stop. The normal pattern is that after every action, the user is brought back to the actions menu until they voluntarily leave the application.
